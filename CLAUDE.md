When writing code, consult with "CODE_STYLE.md"
Each module and sub-module contains following files:
- README.md - description of what the module does. Read it if you want to understand the module or want ot use it.
- DEV_README.md - dev info for the module development. If you are going to modify this module, you need to read it first. If you are just using the module - you do not need this extra info.
- TODOs.md - just a backlog of what might be improved in this module. Usually you do not need to read this file. Especially you do not need to implement these todos.
