# Module name

## Description

## Purpose

# Contents

## Sub-modules
If the module contains submodules, make a list with a short description of each submodule. The description should be a short summary of the README.md file of this submodule. Do not include the detailed description, such as files content of this submodule, a short summary is enough. And after this summary write "to get more info about this sub-module, refer to `./submodule_name/README.md`

## Resources
If the module contains some resources (data, templates), describe them here. No need to be too pricise, just overview.

## Files
If the module contains standalone files (not submodules), list them here with a short summary about each file (its description and purpose), and for each file list all its public functions/variables/classes with their interfaces and short description on each function of what it does (but not how it does it), its purpose, when it should be used. For more complex functions usage example might be included.

If the `__init__.py` file is empty - do not include it into this list.

### Environment requirements
If the module expects something from the environment (for example some env vars set up, some credentials or api keys), describe it here.

If the module uses some external data (outside of this module), describe it.

Note, this section does not include the import requirements, just environment vars and data.
